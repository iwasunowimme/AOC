# AOC

This is the repository for all my resources related the to [Advent Of Code](http://adventofcode.com/). This includes my input files and solution code.
If you wish to attemp Advent of Code (AOC) yourself then the solutions will contain major spoilers.

The year **2020** was the first year that I am attempting the AOC. I will be slowly attempting all past events as well. 
I will use the past event as a means of imporving my coding skills as well as my presentation and code layout.

All attempts will be made using Python.
